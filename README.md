# Risky areas

The Swedish police regulary updates a list of areas they classify to be at a certain risk.

This repository contains that list in a more programatically consumable way :)

> "A risk area is an exposed area where the situation is so "alarming" that it risks becoming a particularly exposed area."

> A vulnerable area means a geographically defined area with low socio-economic status and criminal influence where residents experience insecurity "which leads to a reduced tendency to report crimes and participate in the legal process".

> A particularly vulnerable area means that it is a vulnerable area where there is a reluctance to participate in legal proceedings, that it is difficult or almost impossible for the police to fulfill their mission and that the area has to some extent "parallel social structures and extremism"
